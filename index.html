     <h3>Work Experience</h3>
     <P>I have worked in so many places and acquired several skills and experience. Some of the jobs are:</P>
   <ul>

     <li>Focal person (I am currently volunteering with Minority Womyn in Action, an LBQ organisation, as a community outreach person.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>I decided to join programming after I was informed by a friend about the access programme.To be honest. I did not know what it entailed, all I knew was that I wanted to add more skills. I was skeptical at first,
     but after interacting with the first content and realizing that programming involves creating something out of nothing and working your way towards making it great. This made me so interested because I have great interest in art, creativity and design, and to me, programming contains this in the coding.
