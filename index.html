  <p>This is a project about an organisation that is centered on empowering women and young girls in various communities in Kenya. Here we see a realisation of the charllenges they face and how best we can reduce these challenges by some percentage using creativity as a drive to help them avoid some of the issues they face.
    This also shows how we can use art to conserve our environment and earn while at it.This is basically an improvement of Infinity Designs, which was my first project.</p>
